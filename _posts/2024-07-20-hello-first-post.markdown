# Welcome to My Blog

## About Me

Hello! My name is Andrew Leahey, and I'm a tax and technology attorney based in New Jersey and Philadelphia. I write columns on tax law and policy, technology, energy, and economic justice. My work has been featured in Forbes, Bloomberg Tax, Law360, TechCrunch, and Baseball Prospectus.

I also teach as an adjunct professor at Drexel Kline School of Law and run the Mastodon instance esq.social for legal professionals. In addition to my legal practice and writing, I'm involved with a daily legal news newsletter and podcast that summarizes and comments on the top stories of the day.

## What to Expect from This Blog

In this blog, I'll be sharing insights and commentary on various topics at the intersection of tax, technology, and policy. You can expect posts on recent developments in tax law, analyses of court cases, and discussions on the broader implications of technology and policy changes. My goal is to provide you with valuable information and perspectives that can help you stay informed and engaged with these critical issues.

Thank you for visiting, and I look forward to sharing my inane observations with you!
