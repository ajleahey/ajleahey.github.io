title: 'Twenty Years of Domain Anticipation '

If you visit [leahey.net](https://leahey.net) you'll now find it redirects to this site. This is the culmination of twenty years of patient waiting and setting reminders on my calendar for dates in the distant future when it might expire.

And yet, I feel empty inside. Or rather, I feel as though my new domain will soon feel empty inside. It joins dozens of others that I have only the vaguest of notions as to use: a blog, a personal site, a repository for my writing. A quasi-professional blog as against my quasi-personal one.

Meaningless distinctions in furtherance of justifying owning numerous little parcels of real estate on gTLDs when, in reality, my total output isn't enough to justify even one.
