# About Me

Hello! I'm Andrew Leahey, a tax law and policy expert with a deep passion for making complex tax issues accessible and engaging. My background blends academia and practical tax law, and I specialize in creating insightful and educational content for students at various academic levels, from undergraduates to law school attendees. I strive to combine rigorous analysis of legislative developments with a thorough understanding of policy implications, ensuring that my materials are both relevant and thought-provoking.

I hold an LL.M. in Taxation from New York University School of Law, where I wrote my thesis on "Distributive Justice, Indirect Tax and Emerging Technologies: Problems and Solutions." I also earned a Juris Doctor from Rutgers University School of Law and a B.A. in Political Science from the University of Pennsylvania. My academic journey has been distinguished by numerous scholarships and published theses.

Currently, I am an Adjunct Professor at Drexel Kline School of Law, where I teach courses on Tax Policy, Legal Systems in Action, and the American Legal System. My previous academic roles include serving as a Graduate Tax Teaching Assistant at Boston University School of Law, where I taught courses on Tax, Technology, and Fraud.

In addition to my teaching roles, I write a weekly column for Bloomberg Tax titled "Technically Speaking," where I explore topics at the intersection of tax, technology, and policy. I am also a regular contributor to Forbes and have written for Law360, TechCrunch, and Baseball Prospectus. My consultancy work at Hunter Creek Consulting, LLC, and my role as a Tax and Technology Attorney further underscore my interdisciplinary skill set.

Outside of my professional life, I enjoy podcasting and am the co-host of "ESQUIRING MINDS," a weekly legal-tech podcast, and "Minimum Competence," a short daily podcast covering legal news. I am also actively involved in the Mastodon community, running the largest instance dedicated to law and legal-adjacent professionals.

Thank you for visiting my page. I look forward to engaging with you and exploring the fascinating world of tax law and policy together.
