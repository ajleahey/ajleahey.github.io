## Front Matter  
Short essays on foundational concepts I touch on early in my classes — the ideas that help students *think like lawyers* before they dive into doctrine.

Each piece stands alone and is written to be readable and useful whether you’re in my classroom, another classroom, or just curious about how legal reasoning works.
